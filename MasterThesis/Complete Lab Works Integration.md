# MASTER'S THESIS - LAB WORKS INTEGRATION MAP
## AI-Enabled Requirements Engineering Specification Using RAG

---

## LAB 01: Automated Thesis Synthesis and Multimedia Content Generation(NotebookLM)
### What Was Done:
- Uploaded thesis draft and 3 key scientific papers to NotebookLM
- Video overview, Audio overview, Reports, Flashcards and MindMap
- Automated summarization of contextual studies.

### Key Contributions to Your Thesis
- Defining the Problem Statement and Research Gap :- The sources explicitly highlight the core problem your thesis must address: the difficulty of specifying requirements for probabilistic AI/ML models and the need for new methods to achieve explainability.
- Structuring the Literature Review :- The systematic mapping provides a natural way to organize your Literature Review chapter.
- Providing Technical Components for Your Approach :- The sources give you specific, cutting-edge AI techniques to incorporate into the design of your novel approach.

```
Technique  →    Source Context  → Thesis Integration Role
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Transformer Models (e.g., BERT)        →    Automated NFR Classification  → Foundation: Supports automated reading and structuring of textual requirements.
Knowledge Graphs (KG)   →    Multimodal data fusion for diagnosis  → Structure: Provides a formal, traceable, and interconnected model for requirements, constraints, and design rationale.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)   →    Generating dependable explanations  → Verification & Explanation: Ensures system output (requirements, documentation, rationale) is grounded in authoritative sources, boosting reliability and meeting the need for explainability.

## LAB 02: End-to-End AI-Driven RE Solution and Process Modeling
- Created (X, y) examples:
  * X = Chatbot input from the customer/ person 
  * y = Extracted functional requirements

### Key Contributions to Your Thesis
- The need to automate elicitation, analysis, and formalization from unstructured natural language is the problem statement. The goal is a validated, structured SRS.
- The Examples of (X, y) Pairs are the empirical data used for training and testing, which will be referenced here.
- The proposed areas (Predictive Quality, Anomaly Detection, Process Mining) represent high-value, research-worthy extensions to your novel approach.
