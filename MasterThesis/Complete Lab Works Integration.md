# MASTER'S THESIS - LAB WORKS INTEGRATION MAP
## AI-Enabled Requirements Engineering Specification Using RAG

---

## LAB 01: Automated Thesis Synthesis and Multimedia Content Generation(NotebookLM)
### What Was Done:
- Uploaded thesis draft and 3 key scientific papers to NotebookLM
- Video overview, Audio overview, Reports, Flashcards and MindMap
- Automated summarization of contextual studies.

### Key Contributions to Your Thesis
- Defining the Problem Statement and Research Gap :- The sources explicitly highlight the core problem your thesis must address: the difficulty of specifying requirements for probabilistic AI/ML models and the need for new methods to achieve explainability.
- Structuring the Literature Review :- The systematic mapping provides a natural way to organize your Literature Review chapter.
- Providing Technical Components for Your Approach :- The sources give you specific, cutting-edge AI techniques to incorporate into the design of your novel approach.

```
Technique  →    Source Context  → Thesis Integration Role
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Transformer Models (e.g., BERT)        →    Automated NFR Classification  → Foundation: Supports automated reading and structuring of textual requirements.
Knowledge Graphs (KG)   →    Multimodal data fusion for diagnosis  → Structure: Provides a formal, traceable, and interconnected model for requirements, constraints, and design rationale.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)   →    Generating dependable explanations  → Verification & Explanation: Ensures system output (requirements, documentation, rationale) is grounded in authoritative sources, boosting reliability and meeting the need for explainability.

## LAB 02: End-to-End AI-Driven RE Solution and Process Modeling
- Created (X, y) examples:
  * X = Chatbot input from the customer/ person 
  * y = Extracted functional requirements

### Key Contributions to Your Thesis
- The need to automate elicitation, analysis, and formalization from unstructured natural language is the problem statement. The goal is a validated, structured SRS.
- The Examples of (X, y) Pairs are the empirical data used for training and testing, which will be referenced here.
- The proposed areas (Predictive Quality, Anomaly Detection, Process Mining) represent high-value, research-worthy extensions to your novel approach.

## LAB 03: UML System Design and GAI Integration
- Identified  a firm : A retail Babk (swedbank lithuania)
- Created UML diagrams using PlantUML + LLM assistance:
  * Class Diagram
  * Component Diagram
  * Sequence Diagram
  * Activity Diagram
- Showed GAI integration architecture

### Key Contributions to Your Thesis
- The thesis now promises practical benefits for the bank, such as automated requirement extraction from chat logs, improved compliance traceability, and faster drafting of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
- The Sequence Diagram and Activity Diagram provide a step-by-step methodology for the system's operation, from collecting chat transcripts and anonymizing text to the final storage in the SRS Repository.
- The Requirement class includes the attribute provenance (a list of chunkIds), solidifying how the solution maintains traceability back to the raw stakeholder input.
