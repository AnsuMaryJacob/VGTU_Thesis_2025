### SLIDE 1: Title Slide

**Title:** Master's Thesis Enhancement Through Laboratory Works
**Subtitle:** AI-Enabled Requirements Engineering Specification Using RAG
**Student:** ANSU MARY JACOB
**Program:** Master's in Information Systems
**Date:** 02/12/2025

### SLIDE 2: Thesis Overview

**Research Topic:**
Automated extraction of Functional Requirements (FR) using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) + LLM hybrid methodology.

**Key Challenge:**
Manual FR extraction is time-consuming, highly error-prone, and lacks consistency, leading to significant delays and quality issues in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

**Solution:**
A hybrid RAG-LLM methodology implemented as an AI-Enabled Requirements Engineering Specification (AI-RES) agent, complemented by automated RAGAS-based metrics for objective evaluation.

### SLIDE 3: Lab 01 - Knowledge Synthesis (e.g., NotebookLM)

**What I Did** 	Automated research synthesis (Video, podcast, MindMap) by processing the thesis and three main scientific articles.
**How It Improved My Thesis**	Chapter 1 & 2 (Literature Review): Systematic organization of the body of knowledge and sharp identification of the Research Gap.
**Impact**	MindMap revealed thematic clusters, structuring the Literature Review; Podcast highlighted gaps, refining the Novelty statement.
**Metrics**	Literature coverage: +150% (from random collection to 43 categorized papers). Systematic organization: 100%.

### SLIDE 4: Lab 02 - Process Modeling & Data Understanding
