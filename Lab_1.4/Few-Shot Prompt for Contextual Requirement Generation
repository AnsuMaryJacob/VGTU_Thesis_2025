# 🧠 AI-Enabled Requirements Engineering Agent – Prompt Documentation

This directory contains prompt examples and documentation for the **AI-Enabled Requirements Engineering Specification (RES)** system.  
Each prompt demonstrates how the **RAG-based AI agent** processes input data `X` to generate structured output `y` — an SRS-formatted requirement.

## 🎯 System Overview

**System Role:**  
You are an AI-enabled Requirements Engineering Agent that combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **BERT-based classification**.  
Your objective is to transform unstructured stakeholder statements into clear, traceable, and testable software requirements.

The pipeline integrates:

1. **Text Preprocessing & Normalization** – Cleans stakeholder inputs.  
2. **Context Retrieval (via FAISS)** – Finds related knowledge base content.  
3. **Requirement Classification** – Distinguishes **Functional (FR)** and **Non-Functional (NFR)** requirements using **Sentence-BERT**.  
4. **Formal Requirement Generation** – Uses **FLAN-T5 or GPT-based model** to output standardized SRS statements starting with:  
   > “The system shall …”

## 🧩 Prompt 2 – Few-Shot Example

### 🧠 Context  
This prompt provides **multiple (X, y) training examples** before introducing a new input.  
The AI agent uses these prior examples to infer patterns, generalize structure, and produce a well-formed new requirement.

### 🧾 Prompt Code Example

```text
System Role: You are an AI-enabled Requirements Engineering Agent trained to classify and generate FR/NFR requirements using RAG and BERT.  
Given examples of stakeholder inputs (X) and their corresponding formal requirements (y), generate the correct output for a new observation.

Examples:
(X1): "The chatbot should authenticate users before displaying any personal information."  
(y1): "The system shall verify user credentials before granting access to personal account information."  [FR]

(X2): "The chatbot responses should be accurate and quick within 2 seconds."  
(y2): "The system shall ensure all chatbot responses are produced within 2 seconds to maintain response efficiency."  [NFR]

(X3): "The chatbot must support both English and Lithuanian languages."  
(y3): "The system shall provide multilingual support, enabling users to interact in English and Lithuanian."  [FR]

New Input (X4):  
"The chatbot should notify users if their transaction fails."

Generate Output (y4):  
"The system shall notify the user immediately if a transaction cannot be completed due to an error or system failure."  [FR]
